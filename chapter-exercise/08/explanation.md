This script showcases a simple implementation of the Observer design pattern in JavaScript. It has a few key classes and concepts:

1. `Observable`: This is the base class for classes that wish to provide a subscription-based model for notifications. It manages a list of observers and provides methods to add, remove, and notify these observers. The `notify` method is used to inform all subscribed observers of an event or change in state, and it does this by calling each observer's `update` method with the necessary data.

2. `Stock`: This class extends `Observable` to represent a stock with a name and price. It provides an `updatePrice` method that changes the price of the stock, validates the input, and notifies all observers of this price change.

3. Observer Classes (`PriceDisplay`, `PriceThresholdNotifier`, and `PercentageChangeNotifier`): Each of these classes has an `update` method, which is called when the `Stock` object's price changes. These methods define different behaviors based on the updated price:
   - `PriceDisplay` just logs the new price to the `reports` array.
   - `PriceThresholdNotifier` checks if the new price exceeds a pre-set threshold and logs a message to the `reports` array if so.
   - `PercentageChangeNotifier` calculates the percentage change in price from the previous update, and logs a message to the `reports` array if this change exceeds a certain percentage.

In the main script, a `Stock` object is created along with several observer objects. The observers are added to the stock, the stock's price is updated several times using an array of prices, some observers are then removed, and the price is updated again. The resulting `reports` array, which has been populated by the observer classes, is then logged to the console.

This example showcases the power of the Observer design pattern for creating decoupled systems. The `Stock` class doesn't need to know anything about what the observers do with the price updates - it just sends the updates out. Similarly, each observer class operates independently of the others. This makes the system flexible and easy to extend. For instance, we could add new types of observer classes without needing to modify the `Stock` or `Observable` classes at all.
